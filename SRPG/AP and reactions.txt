AP system somewhat similar to FFT's CT, but AP is more of a resource
-AP should be a universal resource that is of equal value to each character.
	-However, some characters may do specific actions they excel at with a lower AP cost.
-HUD must show turn order!
-Forecast the player's position in turn order if they do a particular action

-Ability to delay your turn to right after another character's
	-If a character delays to after their ally, you cannot "butt in" between their turns
	-This may encourage coordinated team attacks

-Basics: Each character gains AP at the same rate. Their turn starts when they reach an AP amount
	specified by their class. "Faster" classes would have a lower threshold. They get their
	turns more often, but they have less AP to play with. However, they can delay their turn
	to gain more AP. Every character will have an AP cap (variable size?), so if they delay
	their turn too long they can exceed this cap and gain no additional AP for waiting.

	Characters can use various amounts of AP to perform actions. Certain characters may have
	a different range of AP usage that is somewhat connected to their "fastness". For instance,
	a thief may only have a low AP weak attack, but a fighter could have that as well as a high
	AP strong attack. Perhaps the fighter may only have a medium and heavy attack, since the
	strength required for a sword swing is greater than that of a dagger.




-Mages can spend their turn charging, maybe sink a variable amount of AP into it
	-Any turn they can release any spell they've charged long enough for
	-This allows them to use a spell as a reaction
	-This could replace MP entirely

Reactions!

-Reaction reactions: huge AP cost
-Limited by class? i.e. thieves dodge, fighters block, etc
