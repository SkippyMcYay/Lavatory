AP system
=========
While no character has enough AP for a turn, everyone gets +X AP
When someone gets enough AP, their turn begins
	-Multiple characters may get turns on the same "clocktick"

Characters have multiple actions with different AP costs
	-Strong and weak attack

Character Parameters

Reactions
=========
Take a turn when you get targeted by someone else
Player is prompted if they want to react
During reaction turn AP costs are doubled, or alternatively have an initial reaction cost
Your AP starts at your current amount when you react, not your [AP needed for turn] value
After your reaction, your opponent's action completes
	-If possible: make attacks track if the target remains in attack range

Extra
=====
Moving other characters - maybe a shove option like Fire Emblem, also diff shove distances
 with diff AP costs
