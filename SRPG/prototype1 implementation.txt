Game loop
=========
1. While waitTime = 0 && AP >= APForTurn  for at least one actor
    a. Start turn loop for actor with highest AP - APForTurn (needs tiebreaker eventually)
2. While waitTime = -1 && AP >= APForTurn for at least one actor
    a. Start turn loop for actor with highest AP - APForTurn
3. Increase all living actors' AP by APGainPerTurn (same for everyone)
4. Decrease waitTime by 1 for each actor with waitTime >= 0

Turn loop
=========
1. Display turn menu
    a. If AP >= APForTurn && preactionTurn == false display Delay; otherwise display End Turn
2. Wait for following selections
    a. Act
        1. Display action menu
        2. Wait for following events
            a. Action selected
                1. Display target range
                2. Wait for following events
                    a. Valid space selected (contains an actor)
                        1. Display damage/accuracy forecast against targeted actor
                            a. Confirm to continue
                            b. Cancel to return to 2a2a1
                        2. Decrease actor's AP
                        3. If action is offensive, prompt targeted actor for preaction
                            a. If confirmed, start turn loop for targeted actor
                        4. Resolve action if target actor still in range
                        5. Return to 1
                    b. Invalid space selected
                        1. Error message/sound, or do nothing
                        2. Return to 2a2a1
                    c. Cancel
                        1. Return to 2a1
            b. Cancel
                1. Return to 1
    b. Move
        1. Display move range
        2. Wait for following events
            a. Valid Space selected
                1. Move actor to space
                2. Decrease actor's AP
                3. Return to 1
            b. Invalid space selected
                1. Error message/sound, or do nothing
                2. Return to 1b1
            c. Cancel
                1. Return to 1
    c. Defend
        1. Set actor to defending
        2. Exit turn loop
    d. Delay
        1. Display turn order
            a. If target actor's waitTime == 0 || their AP >= APForTurn, they can't be selected
            b. All others can be selected
        2. Wait for following events
            a. Actor selected
                1. This actor's waitTime = target's Ceiling((APForTurn - AP)/APGainPerTurn)
                2. Exit turn loop
            b. Cancel
                1. Return to 1
    e. End turn
        1. Exit turn loop



Turn order display
==================
Show current actor at top
Display & highlight actors w/ waitTime ==0 && AP>=APForTurn in order of highest AP - APForTurn
Display & highlight actors w/ waitTime ==-1 && AP>=APForTurn in order of highest AP - APForTurn
Display living actors in order of highest AP - APForTurn
For each living actor, display AP:APForTurn and/or APForTurn - AP

When an actor is killed (HP <= 0)
=================================
AP = 0
HP = 0


What the attack formula should look like maybe
person1.getAttack() + person1.attacks[attackID].getDamage() - person2.getDefense()
